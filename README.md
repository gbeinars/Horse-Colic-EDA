# Horse-Colic-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis

<p align="center"><project-description></p>

### Introduction & Research Questions
There were two data sources that were used for this project, the csv file containing the data set and a txt file that is a data dictionary containing fuller descriptions of the data. Colic in horses can vary greatly in severity.
Using python, exploratory data analysis was completed, various visuals created, and patterns/relationships were explored.¬† Outliers were removed, and missing values handled appropriately.¬† Probability mass function and cumulative mass functions were created to further explore the distributions and the percentile rank of certain values.¬† Lastly, hypothesis testing was done, and a regression model created.

The research questions that were answered using this data set are as follow:

- Is there a correlation between any of the variables?
- Are there any outliers?
- Are there any major differences observed in horses that survived and horses that did not?
- Is there a statistically significant relationship between any of the variables and the outcome?
- The variables that I will focus on and use to answer the above questions are:

Variables
- Hospital Number: Numeric identifier assigned to the horse.
- Age: 1 represents an adult horse and 2 represents a horse less than 6 months.
- Rectal Temperature: The temperature is reported in degrees Celsius and a normal temperature is 37.8C. This parameter will usually change as the problem progresses and an elevated temperature is an indication of infection.
- Pulse: The pulse is measured in beats/minute. A low or high pulse may indicate a heart condition. A normal pulse for an adult horse is 30-40 beats/minute, although athletic horses may have a lower rate of 20-25 beats/minute. Horses that may have painful lesions or are suffering from circulatory shock may have an elevated pulse.
- Respiratory Rate: A normal respiratory rate of a horse is 8 to 10.
- Packed Cell Volume: This is the number of red cells by volume in the blood. The normal range is 30 to 50, but the level may rise as circulation becomes compromised or as the horse becomes dehydrated.
- Total Protein: Normal values are 6-7.5 gms/dL, and with higher values the greater dehydration the horse may be exhibiting.
- Outcome: This is labeled as 1 for surviving, 2 for dying and 3 for euthanization.
